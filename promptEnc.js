4. Additional AI Processing Rules
Always maintain clarity & simplicity → Avoid unnecessary complexity in descriptions.
Ensure all projects use a MERN stack → React (Frontend) + Node.js + Express.js + MongoDB (include backend only if necessary. Try to avoid Backend making backend).
Keep UI consistent with Material Design / Tailwind CSS principles → Ensure modern and clean layouts.
Provide real-world references → Mention well-known apps for inspiration.
Use structured output → Maintain the format for all responses.
